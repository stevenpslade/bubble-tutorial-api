# Unnamed Bubble Tutorial (Rails API)

Bubble Tutorials allows users to put beautiful, engaging tutorials on their website.

## How It Works

- User signs up on our admin site and receives a script to copy on to their website
- User can create tutorials with steps/content such as number of items in tutorial, content, actions, etc.
- This script communications with our Rails API, which sends the tutorial data to the site
- The script on the user's website displays the tutorials
